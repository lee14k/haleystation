              For weddings, the main room is intended as a ceremony space that
              can smoothly transition to the dinner reception and dancing and
              entertainment space. The guests can enjoy a smooth transition to
              our back lounge area and through to the adjacent outdoor courtyard
              space through the back door for cocktail hour and later during the
              reception. The outdoor courtyard features thoughtful year-round
              landscaping, charming festoon string lights, and outdoor space
              heaters if necessary. As a year-round venue, clients always have
              the peace of mind of knowing that inclement weather will not
              impact their special day as an outdoor location would â€“ there is
              no need for a rain plan at Haley Station.
