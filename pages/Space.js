                  For weddings, the main room is intended as a ceremony space
                  that can smoothly transition to the dinner reception and
                  dancing and entertainment space. The guests can enjoy a smooth
                  transition to our back lounge area and through to the adjacent
                  outdoor courtyard space through the back door for cocktail
                  hour and later during the reception.

                The outdoor courtyard features thoughtful year-round
                  landscaping, charming festoon string lights, and outdoor space
                  heaters if necessary.
                  As a year-round venue, clients always have the peace of mind
                  of knowing that inclement weather will not impact their
                  special day as an outdoor location would â€“ there is no need
                  for a rain plan at Haley Station.
